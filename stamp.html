    <h16>Stamp Event Discovery</h16>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p7>Adele H. Stamp Student Union (STAMP) is the student activity center at the University of Maryland. It aims to nurture a welcoming and inclusive community through events, resources, and intentional programming. 
	<br>
	<br>With over <span class="light-font">3,000 events</span> happening in and around the building each year, it is nearly impossible to keep students in the loop. Conversely, students have a hard time finding events that interest them.</p7>

			<h15>The Problem</h15>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h17>The university is home to 40,000+ students who have a wide range of social media preferences, interests, and habits. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the marketing and communications department to <span class="dark-font">effectively communicate and engage</span> with the community.</h17>
			</div>
		</div>
		<a name="how"><h10>How can we help?</h10></a>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>Despite having a dedicated website, the departments of STAMP use various channels of communication (social media, email newsletters etc.) and none to their best potential. We felt the need to assist STAMP Marketing in finding ways to improve their platforms of communication.
		<br>
		<br>A semester-long project was conducted to understand how students discover & track events that take place in UMD, especially in STAMP. Through contextual design, we aimed to discover new insights into the way students find events, and propose the best ways for the marketing team to reach their audience.

		<h10>Background Research</h10>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>As students at the University of Maryland, our research team is in and around STAMP at least 4-5 times a week, and we still felt like we were unprepared and ignorant of the events available to us.</p>
		<br>
		<p6>Through talking with other students we found that the website was hard to navigate, and did not easily present relevant information about upcoming events.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<a name="meeting"><br></a>
							
				
		<div class="row2">

			
			
<div class="columnhalf">
			<h10>Meet the Client</h10>
			<br>
			<br>
				<p6>We presented our problem statement and initial assumptions to our client. Through this meeting we learned that the scope of our project was too narrow. While the website is a resource some students use, the vast majority find out about events through alternative channels.  Eva asked us to discover which marketing channels are most effective, and where there is room for improvement in their marketing strategies.</p>

		<h10>Challenges</h10>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>The main challenge with this project was finding appropriate research subjects. In order to get data that reflected the entire student body, we needed to interview a diverse set of students. This was a difficult task given our strict project timeline. This project was completed for a User Experience Research course, and we were given two-weeks to conduct our interviews.</p>

		<h10>Interview Focus</h10>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>Through our interviews we primarily focused on gathering data about the following:</p>
			<div class="alist">
				<ul class="a">
					<li>How do students learn about upcoming events?</li>
					<li>What social media channels do they interact with?</li>
					<li>What do students typically go to STAMP for?</li>
					<li>Do they attend events alone or with others?</li>
					<li>What type of events do they attend?</li>
					<li>Where do they keep track of information about upcoming events they are interested?</li>

		<br>
		<h10>Affinity Diagram</h10>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>The first step of the process what to take all 400+ notes from our interviews one the wall. We went through one by one reading the notes and putting them on the wall, if we noticed that some notes were similar we started to put them near each other and ended up with some preliminary columns or "groups".
		<br>
		<br>
		<div class="row2">

			</div>
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>After we had all the notes on the wall it was time to start breaking the groups down even further. Our goal was to have around 2-4 notes in a group. Once we narrowed down a group we would write a blue note that encompasses the theme from the yellows beneath it.</p6>

		<br>
		
		<p6>After the blue notes were on the wall we started the process of creating pinks. Pink notes are comprised of a few blue note groups. They aim to show what the big picture insight is from all the blue and yellow notes beneath it.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>And last, we created green notes out of the pink notes. Green notes are the big picture themes of the sections of the wall. They help give design insight and show the larger story of our affinity diagram.</p6>

		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>In order to get a better sense of how STAMP and its events fit into the larger context of students lives, we created Day in the Life models for all eight of our interviews. We consolidated the data from these diagrams into a larger model that aims to paint a picture of the event discovery process UMD students go through.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>This model was especially helpful in the design phase of our project because it showed us where, how, and what area of the student's experiences needs the most change.</p6>

		<p6>After each interview we created a sequence diagram of certain parts of their event discovery experience. After we had finished all 8 interviews, we started to notice similarities between our individual sequence models.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>We consolidated the models from our interviews into three aspects, Facebook, Website, Email. We then used these models to inform our design decisions and product concepts.</p6>

	<p6>The next step in our process was to walk through our affinity diagram and see where we could identify areas for STAMP to grow their marketing efforts. Everytime we saw something that was either a Plus, Minus, or we had a Design Idea we captured that on a new sticky note and added it to the wall. After we felt confident we had combed through all the aspects of the diagram we moved on to visioning.</p6>

	<a name="facebook"><h10>Facebook Ads</h10></a>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p6>Our research kept circling back to this theme that most students discover and engage with events through Facebook. Most students see events because their friends have already marked themselves as interested, but we believe STAMP's marketing team should increase their efforts by starting to sponsor events on Facebook. This is a relatively low cost feature on Facebook, and would allow the team to send out event promo to target user groups.</p6>
	<br>
	<br>

	<a name="newsletter"><h10>Personalized Newsletters</h10></a>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p6>Through our research we discovered that students get a lot of email communication from the various departments of STAMP. Sometimes this mail is not always applicable to them, so a lot of students end up never reading or opening emails from STAMP. In an effort to combat, we proposed building a personalized newsletter opt out system. In the beginning of each semester students would get an email where they are able to decide what type of events they are interested in, and then they will only get emails correspond with their preferences.</p6>

	<a name="banners"><h10>Foodcourt Banners</h10></a>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p6>One of our big picture findings was that STAMP was the student's central hub on campus, primarily because of the food court. Many students mentioned in their interviews that they would come to STAMP for food and then happen upon some advertising that was located in the building. Since most students go for the foodcourt we believe it would be beneficial for STAMP to invest in some physical advertising in the food court where they currently do not advertise.</p6>

	<a name="calendar"><h10>Add to Calendar</h10></a>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p6>Something that came to the surface during our research was the need to assist students in planning events. Students liked to be able to quickly add events to their calendar so they could set notification preferences for upcoming events. We encouraged our client to incorporate more "Add to Calendar" buttons on their website. After a students clicks the button the site automatically downloads a .ics file and adds the event to their calendar.</p6>

	<a name="qrcodes"><h10>Poster QR Codes</h10></a>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p6>STAMP currently pores a lot of time and energy into their physical posters. While we found that students were engaged by the posters, the posters didn't invite them to a call to action. Some students would take pictures of the posters and reference them later, and some students would write down the information in their phone. In an effort to streamline this process and provide a simple one-click event details feature we propose adding QR codes to the bottom of the posters. The QR links to the event page where students are able to save the event or subscribe to event notifications.</p6>

	<p6>The final step in our process was to present our findings and product concepts to our client. We were able to sit down with Eva and her two marketing coordinators and present all our data, design ideas, and product concepts to them.</p6>

	<p6>Our clients really enjoyed our presentation and were very thankful for the hardwork we put into this. They were particular interested/surprised by our findings on student's experiences with Facebook as utility rather than a social media. They were excited to take these findings and use them to encourage other departments to continue making and promoting events through Facebook.</p6>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p6>After receiving all of our data, the client is going to take a few weeks to look over the findings and product concepts. Eventually they will share this research with the 11 department heads of STAMP. Our team will present the findings with them, and lead a Q&A session about the specific implications of our research. I am excited to continue working with this client going forward and be able to implement some our our ideas.
