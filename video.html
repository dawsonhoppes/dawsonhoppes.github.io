	<h10>The Milots</h10>
		<br>
		<br>
	<p6>I was hired to film and produce a short video for The Milots wedding ceremony and reception.It is a difficult task capturing a live event on video, and more than that being able to tell the story of that day in just a few short minutes. I shot footage, edited, and coordinated with another videographer for his project.</p>

	<p6>While interning I was challenged with creating a short recap video that told the story of a week long vbs. I learned a lot about finding moments and stories in the most unexpected places. The video was shown to 5,000 people at the end of the week.</p>
