		<br>
    	<br>
    	<p10>Divide is a group pay application designed to simplify restaurant payment.
			<br>
			<br>When you log onto the app you are able to check into the restaurant you are at, join a table with friends, select what you ate, and divide your payment. Everyone on the app has linked their credit cards so that the app is able to transfer funds automatically.

		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>Divide was my first product design project. I studied Cinema in undergrad, but I knew I wanted to transition into UX so I decided to challenge myself and create Divide for my senior thesis. 
		</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>I had no previous experience with UX tools or design concepts so it was all a learning experience. I discovered I loved prototyping and creating user-flows for applications. This project led me to formally pursue UX and apply to my HCI masters program at the University of Maryland.

		<h10>Finding the Problem</h10>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>In order to create my project I knew I needed to find a problem to solve. I thought for a few weeks about how I could try to solve something related to my university, or something at my job, but I was having a hard time finding just the right thing to solve.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>I took a break from a brainstorming session to go out to dinner with a large group of friends. I was having such a good time with everyone, until the check came. We asked the waitress if she could divide our check and they weren't able to, so everyone in my party started pulling out their phone calculators to see how much they needed to pay. Then we all started to venmo one friend our portion of the dinner so they could pay the waitress.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>And then it hit me, <span class="dark-font">this is the problem I should solve</span>! There had to be a simpler way to do this and to simplify the group payment experience.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<a name="interviews"><br></a>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h10>User Interviews</h10>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>Before I started designing I knew I should interview a few people to see if I was the only one experiencing this frustration. Additionally, I wanted to find out if there were any other pain-points I didn't see.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>I went out and interviewed 5 other people from all different ages. Here are some of the most poignant quotes and feelings I captured through my interviews.</p>
		<div class="hideme">
			<div class="quote">
			<h17>"I hate being the person that pays. Everyone forgets to venmo me, or they <span class="dark-font">won't send me the appropriate amount</span>."</h17>

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="hideme">
			<div class="quote">
			<h17>"I never know how to <span class="dark-font">split tip and tax</span> when I'm with a group."</h17>

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="hideme">
			<div class="quote">
			<h17>"I feel bad for the waitress when I'm with a big group, if they are nice they end up splitting the check for us but it sucks she has to complete <span class="dark-font">5 different transactions</span> just to finish up one of her tables."</h17> 

			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="hideme">
			<div class="quote">
			<h17>"It's odd we have so many apps for the restaurant experience. We have Yelp to find places and Venmo to pay each other, but <span class="dark-font">what if there was one for all</span>?"</h17>

		<h10>Project Focus</h10>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>Based off my user interviews, I identified these potential problems with our current group payment systems.</p>
		<div class="alist">
			<ul class="a">
				<li>One person gets stuck with the check and sometimes pays more than they should.</li>
				<li>Sometimes we aren't sure how to divide the check.</li>
				<li>Group payment is also a hassle for the restaurant staff.</li>
				<li>There are too many apps for the restaurant experience.</li>
			</ul>

		<h10>Concept</h10>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>After refining the project focus and problems, I was able to start brainstorming and creating solutions to those problems. Throughout my ideation phase I kept coming back to this idea of a one-stop app for all things food, that could suggest restaurants and provide a simple process for group payment at those restaurants.</p6>

			<brx>
		<h10>Sketching</h10>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>After identifying the problems I started to sketch out some possible solutions. It is always helpful to start drawing out your ideas and getting your big picture concepts down on paper.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>I was able to take these ideas to my faculty advisor and talk through some of the app's functionality before I continued in my design process.</p6>

		<h10>Mapping it Out</h10>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>The next step I took was mapping out just what that the process would look like for the user. Starting with discovering a restaurant all the way through paying and leaving a review.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>Here is the flowchart I created and used to direct my prototyping process.</p6>

		<h10>Prototyping</h10>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>After I knew the pages I needed to make I was able to start designing mock-ups and a hi-fidelity prototype. Since I had no experience coding at this point, I decided to create my mockup in Adobe Xd because I was familiar with the Adobe CC suite from my graphic design background.</p6>

		<h10>Usability Testing</h10>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>After I had made the hi-fidelity mockup in Xd I was able to take the prototype to a few users and watch them interact with the program. I took notes of the things that worked, the things that didn't, and the things I didn't expect them to do. I was then able to go back in an refine my designs before the final presentation.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>Here are a few of the most interesting notes I captured during my usability testing:</p6>
		<div class="alist">
			<ul>
				<li>Some users suggested the ability to just pay through the phone and not need to use a card at all. This idea could work in the future but would require more research into how that functionality would actually work with the restaurants.</li>
				<li>There were a lot of questions on how they would find the table number. It might be helpful to provide some type of tutorial video if the app were to be released.</li>
				<li>Need to provide back buttons during the group pay section of the app.</li>
				<li>The header design did not work on all screens (ex: The iPhone X’s black bar made weird spacing issues with the yellow divide circle).</li>
				<li>In future iterations, consider adding a search feature into the discover section.</li>
				<li>Needed to increase contrast for readability on some sections that had a light gray background.</li>
			</ul>

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>The most important thing I learned was just how important it is to <span class="dark-fontconclusion">bring your user into the design process</span>.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>If I hadn't talked to other people in the beginning of the project I would have missed important pain points that would later turned into design insights. This helped me avoid designing for myself, or from the "I" perspective.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>If I were to do this project over again I would spend more time <span class="dark-fontconclusion">diving into user research</span>. In my masters courses I am studying UX research methods and learning how to create solutions through contextual design. While I am pleased with the result of this project, I can see that my designs would have been even stronger if I had more time to conduct contextual inquiries and make additional models from that data. It would also be nice to talk to employees of restaurants to get a deeper understanding of their perspective on this problem.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>In this process I also realized just how valuable it is to conduct usability studies throughout the design process. Users do unexpected things and can sometimes interact with our designs in ways we never thought. Going through the user studies showed me just how important it is to have <span class="dark-fontconclusion">posture of humility</span> in the design phase, so you can admit when something is wrong and make necessary changes. We are designing for the users experience not our own.</p6>
