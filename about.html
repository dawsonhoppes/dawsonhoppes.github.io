		<h1>Summary</h1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>My name is Dawson Hoppes, and I am an aspiring UX/Product Designer.</span></p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>I am from Huntington Beach, CA, but currently live in D.C. while I pursue a masters degree in Human Computer Interaction from the University of Maryland.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>In undergrad I studied Cinema and Media Arts which taught me a lot about communication, teamwork, self-expression, and storytelling.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>My path to UX was a little abnormal, but has equipped and prepared me in unique ways to pursue a career in this field.</p6>

		<p6>I grew up in Huntington Beach, and I love living in the beach cities. I was lucky enough at attend a small high school where we were given the space to try and experiment with a lot of different things.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>I participated in events like band, volleyball, basketball, jazz band, puppet ministry, marching band, student council, school ambassadors, film club, sound team, California Scholastic Federation, woodshop, and a few others, but you get the point.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>Through creating the film program at my school and serving as the Associated Student Body President I learned two very important things: <span class="dark-font">I like creating, and I like people</span>.

		<h0>Why Design?</h0>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>While studying film at Biola, I was able to try my hand at many different lines of work. I worked on multiple film sets, but I always found myself interested in the graphic and visual side of the medium.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>I eventually found myself falling in love with graphic design and I started teaching myself, interning, and learning whatever I could. I decided to take this skill to the next level and I enrolled at a design school in Barcelona.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>I lived, studied, and traveled there for five months and was able to grow so much. I took classes in architecture, product, graphic, and furniture design (a secret hobby of mine), and learned the importance of designing with <span class="dark-font">empathy at the forefront of our thinking</span>.</p6>

		<h0>What's Next?</h0>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>After my semester in Barcelona, I returned to Biola and was able to complete my senior thesis - Divide. I learned so much during that process and it pushed me to formally pursue HCI!</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>Being a film major showed me a different way to look at the world, and studying business showed me a lot about the way people interact with it. I have enjoyed meeting new people, serving as a Resident Advisor, and experiencing God in new ways throughout college. It goes by WAY too fast.</p6>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p6>I am currently pursuing my Masters in Human Computer Interaction. My goal is to become a Product Designer and be able to use design principles to increase connection between people, products, and organizations.</p6>
